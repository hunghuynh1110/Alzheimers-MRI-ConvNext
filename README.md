## Problem Description

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by structural brain changes visible in MRI scans.
The goal of this project is to classify MRI brain slices from the ADNI dataset into Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) or Cognitively Normal (CN) categories.

This project contributes to the open-source PatternAnalysis repository under the recognition branch.
It aims to reproduce a clinically relevant classification model achieving a minimum test accuracy of 0.8, as required in the assessment specification
